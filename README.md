# BlackjackIntro
My first project making a command line blackjack Game

There is also a function which tracks the optimal move for every hand and lets the player know how he's doing

Next steps 
- Simulate how often the player wins using Optimal Strategy
- Implement a UI (maybe using Pygame) to allow the player to practice card counting
